      'The core of the project was to cover the marching route of the army from Tatishchevo, Russia up to Edinburgh, the UK. However, due to the current political situation we were forced to make some changes to the relay starting point. We plan to ride through the countries marked with Anders’ Army footsteps. We commence the ride in the lower course of the Volga river in western Siberia; then will move on through Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan and from there through Turkmenistan to Turkmenbashi at the Caspian Sea. From there we will take the sea route, just like the Army did, to Tehran. After that we will ride through Iran to Iraq and then through Jordan and Israel to Egypt. The Mediterranean Sea will take us to southern Italy where riders will participate in the commemoration of the anniversary of the Battle of Monte Casino. From there riders will reach Milan where they will separate. Some will go up to Edinburgh, where the Anders’ Army went with Wojtek the Bear. The others will ride to the Sobieszewo Island, the site of the 2027 World Scout Jamboree. The relay is planned to finish simultaneously and symbolically in 2 places.',
